# WaniKaniBar

Simple Mac menu bar application for monitoring your [WaniKani](https://wanikani.com) reviews. Dark mode compatible icons and notifications when new reviews are available. This is a fork of bgriffith/WaniKaniBar with some additions.

## Screenshots

Icons come in inactive (no reviews pending) and active (reviews pending). There is also an optional time until next review listing:

There is a notification when reviews become available (soon to be optional). Click on this opens the WaniKani review page:
